ðŸ“§ Email Signature Automation for Microsoft 365
Overview
This project provides an automated way to generate and deploy standardized email signatures for all employees in an organization using Microsoft 365 Exchange Online.

Instead of manually configuring signatures for every user, this solution pulls employee data directly from Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) or an employee dataset and automatically appends professional, branded signatures to outgoing emails.
